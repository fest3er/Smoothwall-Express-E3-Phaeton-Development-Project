# This script prepares the distrib root for the final build. It may be run once only.
#   To re-do the setup, the final files must first be cleaned out. Then this script
#   can be run again.

# This script should not be 'chomod +x' and should only be run from make. But it
#   probably isn't worth rigorously inforcing these restrictions.


# First, get our environment
#
source toolcrib/environment
source toolcrib/functions

# Prepare the directory tree for the final build
