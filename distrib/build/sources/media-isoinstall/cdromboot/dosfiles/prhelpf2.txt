You can do more than just install Phaeton/Roadster:
  linux or <ENTER>: default install
  serial: boot using the first serial port as console
  noisy: let the kernel jabber at you

'linux' and 'serial' have an optional argument:
  single: boot to runlevel S (single-user mode)
  explore: boot to runlevel 1 and a shell to explore the hardware
  install: boot to runlevel 2 to start the installer (default)
  flash: boot to runlevel 3 to morph the install CD to a flash drive

At a shell prompt, type:
  init [ S | 1 | 2 | 3 ]
to change run levels, or '0' to halt/powerdown, or '1' to reboot.

If there are commands missing that would be helpful when exploring the
hardware, please request them via the Phaeton forums.

<F1>-SPLASH  <F2>-(this)  <ENTER>-Start the Installer
