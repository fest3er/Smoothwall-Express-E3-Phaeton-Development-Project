<P>If you have a connection with dynamic IP, the dynamic DNS section of
SmoothWall allows you to use dynamic DNS service provided by dyndns.org,
no-ip.com, hn.org, dhs.org and/or dyns.cx. These services allow people
without a static IP address to have a subdomain name pointing to their
computer, allowing them to run services like a web server, VNC, etc.</P>

<P>The first step for using dynamic DNS with SmoothWall is, of course, to
subscribe to this free service with one of the supported providers. Once this is
done, you just have to fill in the form on SmoothWall's dynamic DNS
configuration page:</P>

<P>Choose the correct service from the drop-down menu.</P>

<P>The checkbox <B>Behind a proxy</B> has to be checked if you're using
the no-ip.com service and if your SmoothWall is behind a proxy. This checkbox is
useless with other services.</P>

<P>The checkbox <B>Enable wildcards</B> allows you to have all the
subdomains of your dynamic DNS hostname pointing to the same IP as your
hostname (e.g. with this checkbox enabled, www.foo.dyndns.org will point to
the same IP as foo.dyndns.org). This checkbox is useless with no-ip.com
service, as they only allow this to be activated or deactivated directly on their
web site.</P>

<P><B>Hostname</B> and <B>Domain</B> have to be filled with the hostname and
domain you chose. E.g. if you chose foo.dyndns.org, foo is your Hostname and
dyndns.org is your Domain.</P>

<P><B>Username</B> and <B>Password</B> are obviously the login information
you chose when you subscribed to one of the dynamic DNS service
providers.</P>

<P>When you're done, just hit <B>Add</B> to save the information you submitted, and
have it appear in the Current hosts section. You may edit that information
later simply by checking the <B>Mark</B> checkbox at the end of the line you want
to edit and then hitting <B>Edit</B>. If you want to keep the information for one
of your dynamic DNS hostnames saved but want to avoid having your IP updated
by the dynamic service provider for this hostname, just edit it, uncheck the
<B>Enable</B> box and save it.</P>

<P>Once you have finished entering all the information regarding your
dynamic DNS hostname(s), you can force an update of all the enabled
hostnames by hitting <B>Force update</B>. Don't do it too often, as dynamic
DNS service providers don't like people who update their IP when it hasn't
changed, and may block hostnames of abusive users. In the future, you won't
need to hit this button anymore as your IP will automatically be updated
each time your IP changes, allowing you to always be able to find your
SmoothWall and your LAN.</P>
